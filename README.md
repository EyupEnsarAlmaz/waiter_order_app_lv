# waiter_order_app_lv

This application was made for Little Venice restaurant in Ireland. When taking orders, waiters have to write the orders on paper and then enter them into the system. If 3 items are full in the system, waiters wait in line to enter the products into the system. During this waiting, it was observed that the waiters focused on other things and did not enter the orders into the system, and the restaurant suffered losses and customers received their orders late.
